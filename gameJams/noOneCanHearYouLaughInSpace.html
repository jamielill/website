            <h2>No one can hear you laugh in space, a gamejam project</h2>
            <p>The theme for this gameJam was "make me laugh". We decided to make a two player 2D puzzle game 
                set on a space station. One player has a freeze ray that can freeze objects and doors, the other
                has an anti-gravity gun which can move objects. The idea is that the combination of these weapons
                will allow the players to mess with each other and create funny situations.
            </p>
            <h3>My contribution</h3>
            <p>My main role was level designer, as this was a puzzle game I had to think carefully about the placement
               of each obstacle and interactable object. I also was incharge of content integration ensuring visual assets
               are imported without compression.
            </p>
