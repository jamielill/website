        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Jamie Lillington, a 19-year-old student currently pursuing a degree in Games Design and Development at the University of Greenwich.
            My passion lies in collaborative game development, and I thrive in the fast-paced environment of game jams, creating a whole game from a theme in only a short amount of time and working with my friends. 
            Additionally, I enjoy using Blender to recreate real-world environments into 3D models. Previously I studied A-levels in Computer Science, Mathematics and Psychology.

                    Organ Sweeper is a fast-paced 2D hospital game where the player has 12 patients to look after. 
                    All of them have problems with their organs, your task is to remove the bad ones, throw them in the bin and replace them with the good organs of fellow patients. 
                    Not everyone can be saved!
