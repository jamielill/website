                <p>
                    Hey! I'm Jamie, a 20-year-old Games Design and Development student at the University of Greenwich.
                    I enjoy participating in gamejams, Dev meet up events and of course gaming with my friends.  
                    The pressure of having to create a game in a 48-36hr time frame really motivates me to be my most creative.
                    As well as this, in my spare time I love trying to recreate things I see around me in 3D! This could be a friend's
                    artwork, a silly GIF or even my Uni Room. Previously I studied A-levels in Computer Science, Mathematics and Psychology.
                    <br><br>
                    Hope you enjoy my portfolio!
                </p>

                        <p>This was my first ever gameJam with the theme of 'Roots', I worked with 3 of my coursemates and we created
                           a two player tile based top down game inspired by 'mine sweeper'.

                        <p>For my second gameJam, I worked with the same team as the first, this theme was 'Welfare'. 
                           OrganSweeper is a fast-paced 2D hospital game made in Unity where the player has 12 patients to look after.

                        <p>The theme for this gameJam was "make me laugh". We decided to make a two player 2D puzzle game 
                           set on a space station.

                           We created a puzzle game set in a sweet shop

                        <p>Our first event was retro games night. We connected old consoles such as: 
                           Wii, MegaDrive, Playstation 2 and NES to the screens in our student bar. 
                           The main attraction was sing star (a karaoke game) on the PS2.
