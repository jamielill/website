                <p>
                    Hey there! I'm Jamie Lillington, a 19-year-old student currently pursuing a degree in Games Design and Development at the University of Greenwich.
                    My passion lies in collaborative game development, and I thrive in the fast-paced environment of game jams, creating a whole game from a theme in only a short amount of time and working with my friends. 
                    Additionally, I enjoy using Blender to recreate real-world environments into 3D models. Previously I studied A-levels in Computer Science, Mathematics and Psychology.

                        <p>This was my first ever gameJam with the theme of 'Roots', I worked with 3 of my coursemates and we created
                           a two player tile based top down game inspired by 'mine sweeper'. The aim is to dig
                           up a mole before your opponent does. However you can also dig up different root vegetables
                           such as the hot potato which explodes a 3x3 grid of tiles, and the beatroot which punches the
                           player to the edge of the map.

                        <p>For my second gameJam, I worked with the same team as the first, this theme was 'Welfare'. 
                           OrganSweeper is a fast-paced 2D hospital game made in Unity where the player has 12 patients to look after. 
                           All of them have problems with their organs, your task is to remove the bad ones,
                           throw them in the bin and replace them with the good organs of fellow patients. 
                           Not everyone can be saved!

                        <h2>No one can hear you laugh in space</h2>
                        <p>The theme for this gameJam was "make me laugh". We decided to make a two player 2D puzzle game 
                           set on a space station. One player has a freeze ray that can freeze objects and doors, the other
                           has an anti-gravity gun which can move objects. The idea is that the combination of these weapons
                           will allow the players to mess with each other and create funny situations.

                        <p>The theme of this gameJam was "moderation". I worked in a much large group of 9 people for this jam.
                           We created a puzzle game set in a sweet shop, NPC's ask for a weight of sweets but your scale is broken!
                           So you must guess (moderate) the amount of sweets to give each person.

                        <p>This group project is a bit different. Our task was to create a custom controller as well
                           as a game in unity to go along with it. Our group decided to make a nuclear reactor control
                           panel puzzle game similar to "please don't touch anything" and "Keep talking and nobody explodes"
                           I designed and created the physical controller.

                           If this happens you must make shots and cocktails such as the Jager Bomb which will explode the
                           enemies.

                           The main attraction was sing star (a karaoke game) on the PS2.
