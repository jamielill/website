            <h1>Game Jams:</h1>
            <p>
                I have been to two game jams, which were hosted by the University of Greenwich. 
                In both events I worked in a 4 person team with my coursemates: Elie, Matt and Andreea

                    A 1v1 local multiplayer game that puts the two players in a grid against each other. 
                    The objective is to find a mole by digging in the right spots but beware there are root vegetables, such as beat-roots and hot potatoes, 
                    that are in the way that can halt or increase your progress. The first to dig up the mole wins.

                    Organ Sweeper is a fast-paced 2D hospital game where the player has 12 patients to look after. 
                    All of them have problems with their organs, your task is to remove the bad ones, throw them in the bin and replace them with the good organs of fellow patients. 
                    Not everyone can be saved!
